# BetterBreakout
A breakout game for android, using the libGDX engine.

# Installation
Download the app from the Google Play Store:

If you are intersted in tweaking with the source, you can clone this repository and import the ```build.gradle``` file into your IDE. 

### Desktop?
If you clone the repository and import it, there should be a desktop build configuration that can be used for debuging or testing. It uses the arrow keys, or A and D.

### iOS/Web
There is another module for compatibility with iOS devices. I do not have any apple devices and therefore cannot test it, but it should theoretically function, although there may be issues with screen resizing and controls.

Certain rendering libraries used by the game are incompatible with HTML/Web, so the game is not available for those platforms.
